    It was a {request.session.get('adjective2', 'tough')} task, but by {request.session.get('verb_ing', 'debugging')} their {request.session.get('plural_noun', 'codes')}, 
    they managed to catch the attention of {request.session.get('software_company', 'Google')}.

    "Wow, this code is so {request.session.get('silly_word', 'blorp')}!" exclaimed the CEO of {request.session.get('software_company', 'Google')}. 
    They {request.session.get('verb_past', 'decided')} to hire the team on the spot. 
    {request.session.get('famous_person', 'Elon Musk')} even called them {request.session.get('adjective3', 'brilliant')}
